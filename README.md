# Word Count Implementations in Go

Welcome to my **Go Word Count Project**! This repository showcases my exploration of various programming styles to solve the same problem: counting word frequencies in a text file. Each solution is implemented in Go with a distinct approach, demonstrating different paradigms in programming.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to count the frequency of words in a given text file, filtering out stop words, and outputting the top 25 most frequent words. Each implementation addresses this challenge using a different programming style.

## Program Files

- **week-01/wc01.go**: No constraints.
- **week-02/wc02.go**: No abstractions, no library functions, slices only.
- **week-02/wc03.go**: Procedural abstraction.
- **week-02/wc04.go**: Functional abstraction.
- **week-02/wc05.go**: Minimal lines of code.
