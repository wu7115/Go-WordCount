# Word Count Implementations in Go

Welcome to my **Go Word Count Project**! This repository showcases my exploration of various programming styles to solve the same problem: counting word frequencies in a text file. Each solution is implemented in Go with a distinct approach, demonstrating different paradigms in programming.

This project is part of my weekly practices for the course **"Analysis of Programming Languages"**, where each week's implementation follows specific constraints to deepen understanding of programming styles and techniques.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to count the frequency of words in a given text file, filtering out stop words, and outputting the top 25 most frequent words. Each implementation addresses this challenge using a different programming style.

## Program Files

**Week 01**
- **wc01.go**: No constraints.

**Week 02**
- **wc02.go**: No abstractions, no library functions, slices only.
- **wc03.go**: Procedural abstraction.
- **wc04.go**: Functional abstraction.
- **wc05.go**: Minimal lines of code.

**Week 03**
- **wc06.go**: Recursive sorting.
- **wc07.go**: Functions accept another function as a parameter for chaining.
- **wc08.go**: Monadic style with wrapping, binding, and unwrapping of values.

**Week 04**
- **wc09.go**: Smalltalk-style object message passing.
- **wc10.go**: JavaScript-style map-based objects with functions as values.
- **wc11.go**: Callback-driven abstraction with entity registration; includes filtering for words with "z."
